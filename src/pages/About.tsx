            I am a senior full-stack software engineer working at PwC. I
            currently spend more time on front-end development and lead a small
            team of software engineers. We build, maintain and improve features
            for an AI driven, voice enabled, virtual assistant.{' '}

            Outside of work my hobbies include traveling. I even completed my
            private pilot license so I can accomplish even more traveling and
            new adventures. I have been to countries as exotic as South Africa
            and Iceland, both of which rank up there as my favorite destinations
            Iâ€™ve ever been. I also enjoy traveling to visit friends and family
            located all over United States and world.
